AnkerWallet for Android
===============

The goal of this project is to build the best free, libre, and open source light wallet for multiple cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc) on Android. Security and usability are, of course, the priorities. For this reason, your private keys never leave the device. Luckily, this wallet is compliant with BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44. A single 24-word mnemonic phrase may be used to recover each and every one of your cryptocurrency wallets.
